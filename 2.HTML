    <br>Isn't she lovely<br>
    Isn't she wonderful<br>
    Isn't she precious<br>
    Less than one minute old<br>
    I never thought through love we'd be<br>
    Making one as lovely as she<br>
    But isn't she lovely made from love<br>
    Isn't she pretty<br>
    Truly the angel's best<br>
